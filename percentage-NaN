   // It will be better to stay a bit loose than this strict req.query checking. 
//Right now even if people add an extraneous query or do a simple mistake this will throw error for the whole card.
//Not to mention it might also have a negative side effect - Imagine later down the line we remove or deprecate a query param, 
//now people might not update the URL even if the query param is deprecated but this code will throw error and users will have no idea why it's failing.

//Instead it will be better if we don't throw instead if a query param is malformed we just ditch that param's value or default it to something sensible.

//Eg for the count_weight if its NaN we just disregard it.
